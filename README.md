Install
-------

1. Install the DeepaMehta 4 WebSockets plugin:  
   <https://github.com/jri/dm4-websockets>

2. Install this example plugin.

3. Start DeepaMehta.


Run
---

1. Open the WebSocket client:  
   <http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.websockets-example/>

   A simple HTML page appears.  
   It opens a WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:8081/` and sends a greeting message.

   In the server log you'll see:

        Apr 18, 2016 5:13:07 PM de.deepamehta.websockets.WebSocketConnection onOpen
        INFO: ### Opening a WebSocket connection for plugin "de.deepamehta.websockets-example"

        Apr 18, 2016 5:13:07 PM de.deepamehta.websockets.demo.WebSocketsDemoPlugin websocketTextMessage
        INFO: ### Receiving message from WebSocket client: "Hello WebSockets server!"

2. In the WebSocket client: open the browser's web console. You'll see:

        Opening WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8081/

   Further messages will appear here soon.

3. In another browser window (or in another browser): open the DeepaMehta Webclient and log in.  
   <http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.webclient/>

4. In the DeepaMehta Webclient: create or edit any topics.  
   All topic update events are broadcasted to all connected WebSocket clients. The events appear in their web consoles.
